# Tasks Done

## Today
- Fixed Twilio inbound call events so `connect`/`disconnect` emit reliably for accepted incoming calls (per-connection listeners on `incoming`).
- Removed debugger statements; added robust logging and state cleanup.
- Displayed dynamic caller number using `conn.parameters.From` (fallbacks included).
- Logged Twilio Call SID on accept.
- Fetched client data by CallSid from API and displayed Booking Ref and Language dynamically.
- Implemented session timer that starts only after call is accepted; removed online waiting timer.
- Added API_INTEGRATION.md documenting Twilio flow and client data endpoint.
- Wired `accepted` to also set on Twilio `connect` to cover auto-accept flows.

## Overall
- Established Twilio Device lifecycle handling: register, incoming, accept, disconnect, token refresh.
- Centralized app-level event bus via `twilioClient.on/emit` and ensured cleanup on offline/unregister.
- Implemented UI for online toggle, incoming call view, accepted call controls, client info, and service user dialing.
- Added resilience: token refresh handling, error forwarding, and safe guards for duplicate events.
